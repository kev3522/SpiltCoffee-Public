## üîÆ NLP Model 
**MODEL**  
Sentiment analysis was conducted based on an ensemble model aggregating both the [VADER model](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) and Facebook‚Äôs wit.ai NLP model. Train and test data was primarily formed from Yelp‚Äôs open data set (>8,000,000 user reviews) and the Sentiment140 Twitter dataset. 

**ACCURACY**  
Running our ensemble model on a subset (test) dataset, we achieved an accuracy 73.35% on a set of 2000 test Yelp points as well as a 74.25% for the Sentiment140 set on their given test set of 497 tweets. 

**NEXT STEPS**  
With spilt coffee, we can eventually provide further detailed analysis per company via reviews and collected text. Analysis on very negative reviews during dips historical trends can provide us with bi- and tri-grams of common phrases used in negative reviews. We can see what users tend to have issues with, and provide actionable recommendations to improve these businesses.

 ‚òê Perform more in depth competitor sentiment analysis, and ability to recognize competitors.  
 ‚òê Allow users to mark wrong sentiments (and correct them). Our models aren't perfect, we have room to grow too!  
 ‚òê We already provide a set of content marked as "extremely negative" or "extremely positive". Now, it's time to extrapolate reasons and analyze severity.   
 ‚òê Scrape more platforms (Facebook, Instagram, more news sources, etc.)
